# MCP45HVX1 Digital Potentiometer Implementation Manual

This driver follows the workspace-standard I2C library pattern: injected
transport callbacks, explicit `Status` returns, managed lifecycle, health
counters, native fake-bus tests, and example-only Arduino helpers.

## Driver Model

The core library never calls `Wire` directly. Applications provide:

- `Config::i2cWrite`
- `Config::i2cWriteRead`
- `Config::i2cUser`
- `Config::busReset` and `Config::controlUser` for optional board-specific
  I2C interface reset

The example adapter in `examples/common/I2cTransport.h` maps `TwoWire` errors to
the driver `Status` model.

## Initialization

`begin()` validates configuration, reads Wiper 0 and TCON0 using the documented
random-read command format, and caches the values. It does not write the analog
state by default.

Optional startup writes are available:

- `Config::writeInitialWiper`
- `Config::writeInitialTcon`

Use these only when changing the wiper/terminal state during MCU startup is
intentional for the hardware design.

`restorePowerOnDefaults()` explicitly writes the documented volatile defaults:
TCON0 `0xFF` and Wiper 0 `0x7F` for 8-bit parts or `0x3F` for 7-bit parts.
`resetI2cState()` calls the optional board reset callback and does not alter
Wiper/TCON state.

## Register Access

Only two addresses are implemented:

- `0x00`: Volatile Wiper 0, R/W/INC/DEC
- `0x04`: Volatile TCON0, R/W

All other addresses are rejected in software before I2C access. This avoids
intentionally generating the device's documented reserved-address NACK state.

MCP45HVX1 reads return two bytes. The first byte is the compatibility MSB and
should be `0x00`; the second byte is the 8-bit register value.

## Wiper Handling

The configured resolution controls input validation:

- `Resolution::Bits7`: `0x00-0x7F`
- `Resolution::Bits8`: `0x00-0xFF`

`incrementWiper()` and `decrementWiper()` send the documented command-byte-only
INC/DEC frames. The driver cache clamps at full-scale and zero-scale after
successful commands.

`readWiperFraction()` and `writeWiperFraction()` provide normalized `0.0-1.0`
position helpers. `stepResistanceOhms()`, `resistanceBToWOhms()`, and
`resistanceAToWOhms()` are ideal nominal helpers from the configured ordering
option. They do not include analog tolerance terms.

## TCON Handling

TCON reserved bits `[7:4]` are forced high on all driver writes. Public helpers
operate on the documented lower bits:

- `R0HW`: software shutdown when cleared
- `R0A`: P0A terminal connection
- `R0W`: P0W terminal connection
- `R0B`: P0B terminal connection

`decodeTcon()`, `readTerminalStatus()`, and `getTerminalMode()` expose decoded
state for CLI and diagnostics.

## Health Tracking

Tracked public I2C operations update:

- last success/error timestamp
- last error `Status`
- consecutive failures
- total failures/successes
- READY/DEGRADED/OFFLINE state

`probe()` uses the raw path and does not update health. `recover()` uses tracked
reads so communication failures are visible in health counters.

Semantic readback failures, such as a non-zero read MSB when
`requireReadMsbZero` is enabled, are also recorded as tracked health failures.

## General Call

The driver exposes helpers for the documented General Call frames. It does not
attempt to configure `GCEN` because the register location is not documented in
the available source notes.

## CLI Coverage

The `01_basic_bringup_cli` example exposes practical chip features:

- device setup: `begin`, `addr`, `res`, `rab`, `scan`, `probe`, `recover`
- register operations: `read`, `dump`, `rreg`, `wreg`, `last`
- wiper operations: `wiper`, `frac`, `pos`, `zero`, `mid`, `max`, `inc`, `dec`
- terminal operations: `tcon`, `term`, `shutdown`, `mode`
- diagnostics: `cfg`, `settings`, `drv`, `info`, `selftest`, `stress`,
  `stress_mix`, `iface_reset`
- General Call frames: `gc wiper`, `gc tcon`, `gc inc`, `gc dec`
