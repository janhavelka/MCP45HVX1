> SDA is the only digital output pin. All other digital signals (SCL, A0, A1, SHDN, WLAT) are input-only. The 0.2 × VL formula means VOL scales with VL; at VL = 5.5 V this gives 1.1 V max VOL (at 5 mA), at VL = 1.8 V this gives 0.36 V max VOL (at 800 µA). [Source: DS20005304B, p. 13]

**Timing Table Notes (complete):** [Source: DS20005304B, p.20]
1. Serial interface equal performance when DGND ≥ V− + 0.9V.
2. As a transmitter, device must provide internal min delay to bridge undefined region (min 300 ns) of SCL falling edge to avoid unintended Start or Stop conditions.
3. Fast-mode (400 kHz) device in standard (100 kHz) system: TSU:DAT ≥ 250 ns must be met. If device stretches SCL Low period, next data bit must be output before TR(max) + TSU:DAT = 1000 + 250 = 1250 ns.
4. Use Cb in pF for calculations.
5. Not tested.
6. Not tested.
7. Host transmitter must provide delay to ensure SDA and SCL fall time differences do not unintentionally create Start or Stop condition.
8. Ensured by TAA 3.4 MHz specification test.
9. WLAT transition within 10 ns before rising edge (Spec 94) and 200 ns after rising edge (Spec 95) of SCL (write data ACK bit) is indeterminate.
