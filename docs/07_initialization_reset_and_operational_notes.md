## 1. Power-On Reset (POR) Behavior

POR occurs when VL rises above the POR threshold from a de-energized state.

On POR, all volatile registers initialize to their default values:

| Register | Address | Default After POR |
|---|---|---|
| Volatile Wiper 0 | 00h | 7Fh (8-bit) or 3Fh (7-bit) |
| Volatile TCON0 | 04h | FFh (all terminals connected, R0HW=1) |
| Device Memory Address Pointer | — | 00h |

[Source: DS20005304B, p. 28, p. 35–36, p. 61]

All terminals (P0A, P0W, P0B) are connected after POR (TCON0 = FFh). The wiper is at mid-scale. [Source: DS20005304B, p. 36]

---

## 2. Brown-Out Reset (BOR) Behavior

BOR occurs when VL drops below the BOR threshold. BOR causes the same register initialization as POR:

| Register | Default After BOR |
|---|---|
| Volatile Wiper 0 | 7Fh (8-bit) or 3Fh (7-bit) |
| Volatile TCON0 | FFh |
| Device Memory Address Pointer | 00h |

[Source: DS20005304B, p. 28, p. 35–36]

> **Gap:** The exact POR and BOR threshold voltages for VL are not specified in the extracted pages of DS20005304B. See `08_variant_differences_and_open_questions.md`.

---

## 3. Power-Up Sequence Requirements

### VL relative to V−

The MCP45HVX1 requires that:

**VL − V− ≤ 5.5 V** at all times [Source: DS20005304B, p. 8]

This means: if V− is biased below GND (e.g., V− = −12 V), then VL must also be brought up in a coordinated manner such that at no point does VL exceed V− + 5.5 V. If V− is −12 V and VL is 3.3 V, the difference = 15.3 V which **violates** this constraint.

> **Implementation note:** The datasheet constraint VL − V− ≤ 5.5 V implies that V− and VL must be sequenced or that V− must be held near DGND during VL power-up, or that VL must not rise until V− has reached its operating voltage. The exact sequencing recommendation is not explicitly stated beyond the voltage constraint. [Source: DS20005304B, p. 8]

### V+ and V−

V+ and V− supply the analog section:
- V+ range: V− to (V− + 36 V)
- V− range: −18 V to GND
- V+ − V− ≤ 36 V

No power-up sequencing order between V+ and V− is explicitly required in the datasheet, beyond the VL−V− constraint. [Source: DS20005304B, p. 8]

### Wiper state during power-up

The wiper position is undefined until POR completes. After POR, the wiper defaults to mid-scale. The I²C interface becomes active after POR. No explicit startup delay time (tPOR) is quantified in the extracted pages. [Source: DS20005304B, p. 28]

> **Gap:** No explicit POR completion time (tPOR) is specified in the available pages. See `08_variant_differences_and_open_questions.md`.

## 4. Software Reset Sequence

Purpose: Reset the MCP45HVX1 I²C state machine to a known state. Use when the device may have latched into an unknown I²C state (e.g., after host reset during a transaction, or after bus noise).

**Does NOT reset register values.** Only the I²C state machine is reset. [Source: DS20005304B, p. 66]

### Sequence (Figure 8-2)

```
S | 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 | S | P
```

Steps:
1. Issue a Start (S) condition.
2. Clock out nine '1' bits on SDA (with SCL toggling).
3. Issue a second Start (S) condition.
4. Issue a Stop (P) condition.

[Source: DS20005304B, p. 66]

### Why each step is needed

| Step | Purpose |
|---|---|
| First Start (S) | Resets device if it is in receive-data (waiting for data) mode |
| Nine '1' bits | Resets device if it is driving SDA Low (ACK or Read data '0'); device sees a NACK, forces reset |
| Second Start (S) | Prevents erroneous write if host was reset while sending a Write command and device was generating ACK |
| Stop (P) | Terminates any current bus activity; device waits for next valid Start |

[Source: DS20005304B, p. 66]

### Effect on other I²C devices

This sequence is described as an invalid command to all standard I²C devices; they should disregard it. [Source: DS20005304B, p. 66]

### Reference

This technique is documented in Microchip Application Note AN1028. [Source: DS20005304B, p. 66]

## 5. Register Default States Summary

| Register | Address | Default (POR/BOR) | Applies To |
|---|---|---|---|
| Volatile Wiper 0 | 00h | 7Fh (8-bit) / 3Fh (7-bit) | All standard variants |
| Volatile TCON0 | 04h | FFh | All variants |
| Device Memory Address Pointer | — | 00h | All variants |
| Reserved (01h–03h) | — | N/A | — |
| Reserved (05h–FFh) | — | N/A | — |

[Source: DS20005304B, p. 28–36, p. 61]

Custom POR/BOR wiper values are available via the NSCAR process. Standard ordering always gives mid-scale. [Source: DS20005304B, p. 76]

---

## 6. First Commands After Reset

After POR/BOR or after the software reset sequence:

1. The Device Memory Address Pointer is set to **00h** (Volatile Wiper 0). [Source: DS20005304B, p. 61]
2. A Read command using the "last address" format (without Repeated Start) will read Wiper 0 (address 00h).
3. No initialization commands are required before the device is operational; it comes up in a fully functional state with mid-scale wiper and all terminals connected.
4. The I²C interface is ready to accept commands immediately after POR.

---

## 7. WLAT Initialization

If the WLAT synchronization feature is **not** used:
- WLAT **must be tied Low** (connected to DGND). [Source: DS20005304B, p. 25]

If WLAT is used for synchronous wiper updates:
- After power-up, ensure WLAT is Low before issuing wiper commands, unless intentional latching is desired.
- During operation: update wipers with WLAT High, then release WLAT Low to apply all changes simultaneously.

WLAT timing constraint (relative to ACK rising edge):
- Must be stable ≥ 10 ns before ACK rising edge
- Must be stable ≥ 200 ns after ACK rising edge
- Transition within this window: **indeterminate** behavior

[Source: DS20005304B, p. 27]

---

## 8. SHDN Pin Initialization

If hardware shutdown is **not** used:
- SHDN must be tied High (connected to VL). [Source: DS20005304B, p. 25]

If SHDN is used:
- On power-up, if SHDN is Low, the device enters the shutdown state (P0A disconnected, P0W shorted to P0B) immediately after POR completes.
- TCON0 registers retain their default (FFh) regardless of SHDN state.
- To restore normal operation, release SHDN High.

[Source: DS20005304B, p. 47]

---

## 9. Power Supply Design Notes

### General

- V+ and V− should reside on the analog power plane, separate from digital power. [Source: DS20005304B, p. 73]
- The digital supply VL should be as clean (low-noise) as possible. [Source: DS20005304B, p. 73]

### Dual-supply constraint

- V+ and V− may be asymmetric (e.g., V+ = +15 V, V− = 0 V) or symmetric (e.g., ±18 V), as long as:
  - V+ − V− ≤ 36 V
  - −18 V ≤ V− ≤ 0 V
  - 0 V ≤ V+ ≤ +18 V
  - VL − V− ≤ 5.5 V
  - VL ≥ 1.8 V (operating)

[Source: DS20005304B, p. 8]

### Terminal voltage constraints

Signals on P0A, P0B, and P0W must remain within V− ≤ Vx ≤ V+. Signals outside this range may damage the device. [Source: DS20005304B, p. 8]

---

## 10. Bypass Capacitor Requirements

From Section 8.11.1 [Source: DS20005304B, p. 73]:

| Supply Pin | Recommended Bypass Capacitor | Placement |
|---|---|---|
| VL | 0.1 µF | Within 4 mm of the VL pin |
| V+ | 0.1 µF | As close as possible |
| V− | (not explicitly stated; inferred from Figure 8-13 context) | — |

> **Note on V− bypass:** Figure 8-13 in the datasheet shows bypass capacitors on VL and V+ but does not explicitly call out V− bypass capacitor requirements in the extracted text. The V− bypass recommendation may be present in application notes not yet read. [Source: DS20005304B, p. 73]

Bypass capacitors filter high-frequency noise induced on power supply traces, minimizing effects on signal integrity. [Source: DS20005304B, p. 73]

---

## 11. Layout Considerations

From Section 8.11.2 [Source: DS20005304B, p. 73–74]:

### Noise

- Multi-layer PCBs with a low-inductance ground plane are recommended.
- Isolate analog inputs/outputs from digital switching signals.
- Proper decoupling is critical for rated performance.
- Breadboards and wire-wrapped boards are **not recommended** if low noise is required.

### PCB area

| Package | Dimensions (mm) | Area (mm²) | Relative Area |
|---|---|---|---|
| 14-TSSOP (ST) | 5.10 × 6.40 | 32.64 | 1.31× |
| 20-VQFN (MQ) | 5.00 × 5.00 | 25.00 | 1× (smallest) |

For space-critical applications, the VQFN package is recommended. [Source: DS20005304B, p. 73]

### Power dissipation

Power dissipation through the resistor network determines thermal operating limits. See Section 12 below.

## 12. Resistor Network Power Dissipation Limits

### RAB power dissipation (TABLE 8-3)

Worst-case: VA = +18 V, VB = −18 V (36 V total). [Source: DS20005304B, p. 74]

| RAB Typical (Ω) | RAB Min (Ω) | RAB Max (Ω) | |VA|+|VB| (V) | Power (mW) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5,000 | 4,000 | 6,000 | 36 | 324 |
| 10,000 | 8,000 | 12,000 | 36 | 162 |
| 50,000 | 40,000 | 60,000 | 36 | 32.4 |
| 100,000 | 80,000 | 120,000 | 36 | 16.2 |

Power = V²/RAB(MIN). [Source: DS20005304B, p. 74]

### RBW power dissipation (TABLE 8-4)

Maximum current conditions (IBW = max IW from electrical specs). [Source: DS20005304B, p. 74]

| RAB Typical (Ω) | |VW|+|VB| (V) | IBW max (mA) | Power (mW) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5,000 | 36 | 25 | 900 |
| 10,000 | 36 | 12.5 | 450 |
| 50,000 | 36 | 6.5 | 234 |
| 100,000 | 36 | 6.5 | 234 |

Power = V × I. [Source: DS20005304B, p. 74]

> The 900 mW figure for the 5 kΩ variant at full voltage swing must be checked against the device's thermal limits (θJA) to ensure junction temperature stays within −40°C to +125°C. See `03_electrical_and_timing.md` for thermal resistance values.
